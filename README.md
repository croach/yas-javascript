This is a collection of JavaScript and Node.js snippets for the
YASnippet template system for Emacs.

Installation
============

Simply copy the `js-mode` directory into the `yas/root-directory` which should be something like `~/.emacs.d/yasnippet-*.*.*/snippets`. If you want to place the folder inside of the `text-mode` folder instead, you must first remove the `.yas-parents` file from the `js-mode` directory.
